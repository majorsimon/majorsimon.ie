	<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			500g strong white bread flour
		</li>
		<li>
			2 sachets instant yeast
		</li>
		<li>
			(Good) Olive oil - more than you'd think
		</li>
		<li>
			400ml cold water
		</li>
		<li>
			2 tsp salt
        </li>
	</ul>

	<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
	<p>Note: season to taste all the way through. Don't be shy with the black pepper. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Add all dry ingredients to bowl. Stir well to combine, then add about 3tbsp of oil and first 300ml of cold water. Using hands or wooden spoon, roughly mix to form a rough dough. Kneading for 5ish minutes, slowly incorporate the rest of the water. It should be a reasonably wet dough. You can add more water if required, but I usually add more oil, though this maybe isn't traditional.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stretch the dough by hand in the bowl, tuck it back in, rotate about 90 degrees, and repeat for about 5 more minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            On an oiled work surface (do not use flour!), knead the dough out for another 5 minutes. Oil your hands to help keep the dough from sticking. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Return the dough to the (oiled) bowl, cover (with cling film or damp towel), and allow to rest for about an hour or until roughly doubled in size.
        </li>
        <li>
            Line two baking trays with parchment paper, divide the dough in two, and (gently) stretch it into the trays, ensuring it gets right into the corners. Drizzle with oil (enough that you don't need to use cling-film to cover the dough), and leave to prove for another hour or so.
        </li>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 200C (fan-assisted). Drizzle loaves with more oil if required, sprinkle with good quality flaky salt and any other toppings (e.g. rosemary, cherry tomatoes), then bake. The bake can take between 20 - 60 minutes depending on your tray and the thickness of your dough etc., so keep an eye on it. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The focaccia will be ready whenever it has a nice colour and crispness on the top, and sounds hollow when knocked on the (not soggy) bottom. As soon as the loaves are out of the oven, drizzle with another finish of olive oil, and get stuck in while it's warm.
        </li>
		<li>
			Serve with <a href='mushroom-bolognese.html'>a mushroom "bolognese"</a>, or some <a href='balsamic-vinaigrette.html'>balsamic vinaigrette</a> to soak it up (or top as bruschetta - yum).
		</li>
