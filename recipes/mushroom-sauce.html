		<li>
			In a saucepan, lightly fry the garlic, onions and mushrooms in a very small amount of oil. Fry on a low - medium heat until just cooked, you don't want too much colour introduced. If using the stock, add to this after the veg are cooked, and allow to sweat off a bit 
		</li>
		<li>
			Meanwhile, in another saucepan, make a roux with the fat and flour. Make it a b√©chamel by slowly adding in your dairy-free milk

			Combine and serve
