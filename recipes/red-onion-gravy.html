	<ul>
		<li>
			Red onions, lots (4 - 8), sliced

		</li>
		<li>
			Vegetable stock, about half a cube in about half a cup water
		</li>
		<li>
			Margarine or reasonably neutral oil
		</li>
		<li>
			Flour
		</li>
		<li>

	<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
	<p>Note: season to taste all the way through. Don't be shy with the black pepper. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			In about 100ml of margarine or fat of choice, fry the onions and garlic over a medium heat. You don't want to deep-fry them, you want them to soften and lightly caramelise. This will take about half an hour or more - don't rush this! 
		</li>
		<li>
			When the onions are nicely softened and a bit sweet, add some flour to coat and act as a thickener for the gravy. Too much and you'll have to water it down so your onions will get lost in the sauce, too little and your gravy will be looser than an altarboy's arse. Cook the flour for about five minutes - this is kinda like making a roux. 
		</li>	
		<li>
			Add the stock, balsamic, wine, and herbs. Additional liquid can be cooked down here, so don't worry if you add too much wine :) 
		</li>
		<li>
			After about 20 more minutes of light simmer, the gravy will be ready
		</li>
