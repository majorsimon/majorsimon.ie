	<h2 id="method">Method</h2>
	<p>Note: season to taste all the way through. Don't be shy with the black pepper. </p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Clean and prep the mushrooms and rest of veg
		</li>
		<li>
            In a large saucepan, heat 2tbsp of good oil (with a reasonably high smoke point) at medium-high. Add the finely chopped mushrooms, and let sit for at least 5 minutes. The mushrooms need a good bit of cooking to get them to give up all of their liquid and make them ready to accept flavour. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the mushrooms have boiled off all their liquid and you can see them start to get some colour, add a good glug of the tamari/soy sauce (and liquid smoke if using), stirring rapidly to ensure good distribution. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to medium, and add the onions. Allow these to cook for a couple of minutes to cool the pan before adding the garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until fragrant. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Now add the tomato purée, and mix thoroughly. Allow this to cook for another couple of minutes, before deglazing the pan with the red wine (if using - if not, add a small amount of water) and balsamic vinegar. Add the bay leaves now also, along with a good helping of black pepper. 
        </li>
        <li>
            After about 5 more minutes allowing the added liquid to reduce a bit, add the tins of tomatoes, and the remaining herbs. Add about a teaspoon of the sweetener of choice (this will combat the tomato seeds' and the purée's bitterness). 
        </li>
        <li>
            <em>Note: You may wish to taste and adjust flavouring at this stage, but this will be futile. Right now the strong flavours are still quite bold, and need time to mellow out a bit before they're ready for tasting. I recommend first tasting about 45 minutes in, then every 10 minutes 'til it's done.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring the contents to a boil, then reduce the heat to low, and add the chopped courgette. Leave on a slow simmer to reduce for about 60 - 90 minutes, or until the volume has reduced to preferred thickness, and all the flavours have mellowed out. 
        </li>
		<li>
			Serve with some pasta, some <a href='focaccia.html'>focaccia</a> to soak it up, and maybe a salad with some <a href='balsamic-vinaigrette.html'>balsamic vinaigrette</a>.
